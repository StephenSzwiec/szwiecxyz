<p>Jordan Douglas started talking to me after class yesterday about VPS,
backup, and server options for hosting your own services, so I
decided to do a bit of a data dump about what the best offerings are
for 2019.I'm going to use this post to drill down some options and
generally blog about solutions that developed out of that
conversation, based on what you might need.</p>
<h2>Cloud Backup and Storage:</h2>
<p>&nbsp; We all know about Azure, Amazon, etc. for corporate ERP and
Cloud server solutions, and these people are typically the way to go
if you're a big data company, but honestly, if you're just someone
who has a lot of stuff you need to get backed up they aren't always
the best. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>I have less than 50GB of
	data</strong> - In this case, you should just zip everything and put
	it on Google cloud, it's free to use. Buy a WD external drive for a
	local backup and you're set. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive">https://drive.google.com/drive</a></p>
	<li><p><strong>I have more than 50GB
	towards 2TB </strong>- At this point free offerings of cloud based
	storage become less attractive and you will want to find some sort
	of proper system setup. Backblaze (<a href="https://backblaze.com/" >https://backblaze.com</a>)
	offers full system backups for Windows and MacOSX computers for
	6$/mo, and exists as an app that encrypts and offloads your data
	(including attached external drives) at a regular interval. If
	app-managed storage isn't your thing, and you instead just want
	somewhere to put files where ever you go both pCloud
	(<a href="https://www.pcloud.com/" >https://www.pcloud.com/</a>)
	and iDrive (<a href="https://www.idrive.com/" >https://www.idrive.com</a>)
	are worth looking at.</p>
	<li><p><strong>I have over 2TB</strong> -this crosses the line from
	where companies stop considering you a private consumer and start
	looking at you like a small business customer, and prices start to
	go up from there including ingest and egress costs applying to
	moving your data off and onto the cloud. For this Backblaze
	(<a href="https://backblaze.com/b2/">https://backblaze.com/b2/</a>)
	still outperforms Amazon ( B2 @ $0.005/GB/mo. vs Amazon
	$0.021/GB/mo.) but be aware with this much data you are actually
	better off buying two harddrives and giving one of them to your mom
	for safekeeping.&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<h2>VPS Hosting and the Cloud</h2>
<p>&nbsp; Today, if you want to run a
website or access a service from somewhere else, pretty much
everybody runs what's called a Virtual Private Server, which is just
a cloud-computing term for a rented computer that does whatever you
want it to. The prices of these things has dropped a lot over the
years and now you can basically get as much or as little as you pay
for. 
</p>
<p><br/>

</p>
<p>&nbsp; Professional computing platforms
include those mentioned by Mr Fenner, and include Microsoft Azure,
Amazon AWS, and Google Cloud. These are all great if you are an
enterprise business and want a scalable, dependable, high-redundancy
system so you can take part in international e-commerce. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p>&nbsp; They are also <em>expensive</em> and all those great
features come at the cost of being incredibly complex. If you're a
private individual or a small business user just getting into making
websites or selling items on a small site, all of this cost and
complexity honestly works against you. Here's a list of the best of
smaller VPS solutions for that usage in mind:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p ><strong>No Support Linux Hosting</strong>
	- (<a href="https://www.nosupportlinuxhosting.com/" >https://www.nosupportlinuxhosting.com/</a>)
	- This is how you can get a website up and running for <u>$1 per
	month</u>. You don't get full control, but instead get a friendly
	GUI based way to publish websites and install ERP, eCommerce, and
	blogging software with just a few clicks. Comes with 1GB of storage.
	This is the cheapest way to get yourself online. The downside to
	this is that you get no help in setting anything up, but that is the
	point of the service. Also worth mentioning is that if your site
	grows quickly, there is no way to scale up the service and your
	users will run into a denial of service this way. Best to avoid for
	any professional use but great for testing things out. 
	</p>
	<li><p><strong>Semi-professional Providers - </strong><strong>include
	providers such as Linode (<a href="https://linode.com/">https://linode.com</a>),
	Vultr (<a href="https://vultr.com/">https://vultr.com</a>), Digital
	Ocean (<a href="https://digitalocean.com/">https://digitalocean.com</a>)
	and ssdNodes (<a href="https://ssdnodes.com/">https://ssdnodes.com</a>)
	all of these provide root-acesss (you are the system owner) of a
	virtual private server (VPS) sitting in a warehouse. These vary by
	amount of support, offerings, and prices, but all of these companies
	are a solid start for hosting a proper business.</strong></p>
	<li><p><strong><b>Low End Box - </b></strong><strong>what
	if you wanted to find something cheaper that you wanted for private
	or small business use, but wanted to shop around for something off
	the beaten path? The best resource site I know of for this is
	LowEndBox (<a href="https://lowendbox.com/">https://lowendbox.com</a>)
	a blog specializing in offering discount coupons for VPS services
	around the web (there are literally hundreds of them)</strong></p>
</ul>
